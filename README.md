# CRUD-operation
This is a simple server application using node.js. Here I have created services for popular Angular 2 [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) tutorial.
In this example you will see REST services to perform basic CRUD operations. I have used Mongodb as database.

## Pre-requisites
Node and Mongodb should be installed.
